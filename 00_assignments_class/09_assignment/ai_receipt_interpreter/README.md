## Overview

**AI Receipt Interpreter** is a modern web application that leverages Google Gemini AI to automatically extract, categorize, and report expenses from uploaded receipt images. Designed for freelancers, small businesses, and anyone who wants to automate expense tracking, it provides a seamless experience from receipt upload to structured reporting and CSV export.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Receipt Parsing:** Upload a photo of a receipt and get structured data (merchant, items, totals, category) instantly.
- **Expense Categorization:** Automatically tags expenses (e.g., Meals, Travel, Office Supplies).
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login system.
- **Subscription Plans & Payments:** Free tier (limited uploads), paid plans for unlimited usage and future integrations.
- **User Dashboard:** View, download, and manage your receipts.
- **CSV Export:** Download individual or all receipts as CSV for accounting.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- **Database Storage:** User and receipt data is securely stored and managed.
- **Python OOP Principles:** The backend is structured using classes for users, payments, and business logic.

## OOP Principles Applied

This project is structured using core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity. Here’s how OOP is applied:

### 1. **Encapsulation**
- Classes such as `Login`, `RegisterUser`, `Logout`, `Payment`, and `PaymentService` encapsulate their own data and behavior.
- Each class manages its own state and exposes only necessary methods.

### 2. **Abstraction**
- Complex operations (like payment validation, user authentication, and AI receipt interpretation) are abstracted into methods within their respective classes.
- The main application interacts with these classes through simple interfaces, hiding internal details.

### 3. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:
  - `Login` handles user authentication.
  - `RegisterUser` handles user registration.
  - `Payment` and `PaymentService` handle payment logic.
  - `Logout` manages user session termination.

### 4. **Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic (user management, payments, receipt processing) is separated from the UI logic (Streamlit interface).
- Utility functions and data storage are kept modular and reusable.

### 5. **Extensibility (Inheritance & Polymorphism Ready)**
- The design allows for easy extension. For example, you could create specialized user types or payment processors by subclassing `User` or `PaymentService`.
- If you add multiple payment gateways, you can define a common interface and have each gateway implement its own version of `process_payment()`.

## Key Code Concepts

### Authentication

- User registration and login with hashed passwords.
- Session management using Streamlit's session state.

### Database

- User and receipt data stored in JSON files.
- Easy migration to SQL databases for scaling.

### Payments

- OOP-based payment processing simulation.
- Ready for integration with real payment gateways.

### Python OOP

- All business logic encapsulated in classes (`User`, `RegisterUser`, `Login`, `Payment`, `PaymentService`).
- Promotes code reuse, maintainability, and scalability.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone repositiry-link-here
    cd ai-receipt-interpreter
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up your Google Gemini API key:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
      ```
      GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
      ```

4. **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
