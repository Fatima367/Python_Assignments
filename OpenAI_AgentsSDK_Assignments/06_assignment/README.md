### Assignment

**Goal**: Make a Library Assistant using the OpenAI Agents SDK.


**It should:**
- Search for books
- Check book availability (only for registered members)
- Give library timings

**Must Use:**
- Agent
- Runner.run / Runner.run_sync
- @function_tool
- @input_guardrail
- RunContextWrapper
- dynamic_instruction
- BaseModel
- ModelSettings


**Steps:**
- User Context → Pydantic model with name and member_id.
- Guardrail Agent → Stops non-library queries.
- Input Guardrail Function → Uses guardrail agent.
- Member Check Function → Allows availability tool only if user is valid.


**Function Tools:**
- Search Book Tool → Returns if the book exists.
- Check Availability Tool → Returns how many copies are available.
- Dynamic Instructions → Personalize based on user name.
- Library Agent → Add tools, guardrails, and model settings.
- Book Database → Store book names and copies in a Python dictionary; tools must use this data.
- Multiple Tools Handling → Make sure agent can search and check availability in one query.
